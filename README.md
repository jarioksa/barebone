Formally this is an **R** package, but its only use to serve as a
platform to generate a vignette `barebone.pdf` that describes the
ordination algorithms used in **vegan** and elsewhere. The functions
in this package are user-unfriendly, and only show the core steps of
ordination assuming the input is exactly correct, and the user knows
how to post-process the raw results. It is the best to read the
vignette which gives the proper documentation.

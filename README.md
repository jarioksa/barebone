## Barebone: not for the faint at heart

Formally this is an **R** package, but its only use is to be a
platform to generate a vignette `barebone.pdf` that describes the
ordination algorithms used in **vegan** and elsewhere. The functions
in this package are user-unfriendly, and only show the core steps of
ordination assuming the input is exactly correct, and the user knows
how to post-process the raw results. It is the best to read the
vignette which gives the proper documentation.

I wrote this document mainly in 2009 for a project that never 
reached its goal, but as the methods are eternal, the vignette still
serves its purpose.

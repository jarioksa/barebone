\item{X}{Model matrix of constraints.}
}
\value{

rows of the first axis.} \item{u}{LC scores for rows of the first axis.}
\item{v}{Column scores of the first axis.}
}
\description{
First axis of Constrained Correspondence Analysis using weighted averaging.
}
\details{
This is a poor algorithm to perform CCA, and is included only to show how
simple it is. Constrained Correspondence Analysis was originally introduced
in ecology as a result of this algorithm (ter Braak 1986). Palmer (1993)
gives a very lucid explanation of the algorithm and its two kind of row
scores, known as Weighted Averages (WA) scores and Linear Combination (LC)
scores.  The function only finds one axis.  It would be possible to find
later axes by orthogonalizing against previous axes, but if several axes are
needed, it is better to use other algorithms from the beginning.
